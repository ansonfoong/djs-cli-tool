# Discord.JS Project Generator

## Installation

`npm install -g discordjs-cli`

This is a simple tool to scaffold a Discord.JS bot.

The cli tool allows you to create and manage your Discord.JS project by adding/registering commands & events, organizing all of your commands & events into its own folder and groups.

You can generate a Discord.JS project with the commando framework, which will provide a slightly different scaffold.

Currently only discord.js is supported, future releases may include discord.py project scaffolds but that might not be guaranteed.
